<!-- // I need to create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and the size of the pizza. If the pizza goes up in size its costs the facility more for toppings and the price should reflect that.

Users need to be able to select from a variety of extra toppings. We should include additional price for extra meats/cheeses but have the price maintain the same for vegies. -->
